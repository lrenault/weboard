Guitar pedalboard in WebAudio.

## Requirements 
No install whatsoever, just have an internet connection so that Pizzicato can be fetched when opening `index.html`.

## Quick-start
- Check `Connect Instrument` for using your input as the audio source (instrument through audio interface, built-in microphone,...)
- Check any effect you want to apply to the audio.
- Change the effect parameters with the sliders or the X-Y pad.

## Audio Engine
- [Pizzicato](https://github.com/alemangui/pizzicato.git)
